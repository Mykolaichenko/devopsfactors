A good DevOps team should have full interchangeability, a flat structure and mutual assistance. If you have several products or dedicated parts of the system in your company, it is necessary to periodically take tasks not from your main specialization to expand your horizons and cultivate interchangeability. A good DevOps team should look like a complete system - all team members can complete the task that has arrived.
