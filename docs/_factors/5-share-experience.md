A strong knowledge gap, even within the same team, always entails problems. A completely different expertise in people on different components of the platform will always lower the teamâ€™s performance and complicate the prediction of delivery. The presence of unique skills in one engineer makes him indispensable and sooner or later he turns into a living point of failure. Therefore, it is necessary to pre-determine gaps and their criticality in advance, quickly eliminate them by exchanging experience and information. High-quality documentation and transparency of the development process greatly simplifies this process.
