The main feature of DevOps methodology is continuous iterative improvement. It's not necessary to theoretically design the most fault-tolerant and stable system with ideal processes for an infinite amount of time - on the contrary, cyclically introduce improvements and receive fast feedback. In this case, it will be possible to design a platform that will meet most of your requirements in a minimum amount of time. In the process of development of the platform must be a constant professional growth.
